A snapshot mod implementing features requested on [Let's talk about the Pale Garden! ](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/30730572844173-Let-s-talk-about-the-Pale-Garden) and [Let's talk about the Creaking!](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/30730545094029-Let-s-talk-about-the-Creaking) minecraft feedback pages!

# Implemented feedback
## Pale Garden
- Biome fog. The fog gets denser during night!
- Pale pumpkins have been added in two varations. Regular and "carved"
- More (chaotic) vegetation (pale flower, tall and small bushes, pumpkins...)
- Fallen trees
- Ambient particles that look like creaking eyes
- Removed mob spawning (and buffed creaking)

## Creaking
- Increased movement speed +50%
- Increased attack damage from 2 to 10
- ~~Close their eyes when you look at them~~ (removed in 24w44a, because mojang implemented their own eye logic)
